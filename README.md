## Project Overview
"Spot the Fake" is an AI-powered system designed to detect and categorize fraudulent online content, including fake websites, apps, and digital content. It empowers users to navigate the internet safely by identifying scams and suspicious content in real-time, providing instant insights and recommendations.

---

## Technology Stack
The backend is built with *FastAPI, ensuring fast and scalable API responses, while the frontend uses **React.js / Next.js* for an intuitive and responsive user interface. *PostgreSQL* or *MongoDB* manages the persistent data, and *JWT-based sessions* handle authentication securely. AI models are integrated using the *OpenAI API, with optional local inference through **Ollama. For cloud deployment, **AWS EC2 and S3* can be utilized for hosting and storage.

---

## Features
- Real-time detection of fake websites and apps  
- Multi-provider AI integration with an easy toggle  
- Persistent session management and message history  
- Comprehensive error handling and optimized performance  
- Optional: Local Ollama server integration for offline AI inference  
- Optional: Full AWS cloud deployment with scalable architecture  

---

## Usage
Once set up, users can submit URLs or content to classify for potential fraud. The system responds in real-time, displaying results in a user-friendly interface. Users can switch between multiple AI providers, track session history, and view database-backed persistence of all interactions. SSE streaming enables live updates for interactive sessions.
